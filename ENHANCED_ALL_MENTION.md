# 🔔 Enhanced @all Mention Feature

## ✨ New Functionality

The `@all` mention feature has been enhanced to support custom messages! Now you can include `@all` anywhere in your message, not just as a standalone command.

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Before (Old Behavior)
```
Input:  @all
Output: 🔔 Group Mention by Vinu
        @anythingnotslavabot @Phanesbot @RickBurpBot
```

### After (New Enhanced Behavior)

#### Simple @all (same as before)
```
Input:  @all
Output: 🔔 Group Mention by Vinu
        @anythingnotslavabot @Phanesbot @RickBurpBot
```

#### Custom Message with @all
```
Input:  Hello @all today is Wednesday
Output: Hello today is Wednesday
        @anythingnotslavabot @Phanesbot @RickBurpBot
        
        Mentioned by Vinu
```

#### @all at the beginning
```
Input:  @all please check the new updates
Output: please check the new updates
        @anythingnotslavabot @Phanesbot @RickBurpBot
        
        Mentioned by Vinu
```

#### @all in the middle
```
Input:  Hey @all we have a meeting at 3pm
Output: Hey we have a meeting at 3pm
        @anythingnotslavabot @Phanesbot @RickBurpBot
        
        Mentioned by Vinu
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Message Processing
1. **Detection**: Checks if `@all` appears anywhere in the message (case-insensitive)
2. **Extraction**: Removes `@all` from the original text to create the custom message
3. **Formatting**: Applies different formatting based on whether there's custom content

### Message Formats

#### With Custom Message
```
[Custom Message Content]
[Mention List]

[Attribution]
```

#### Without Custom Message (just @all)
```
🔔 Group Mention by [User]

[Mention List]
```

### Multi-Tier Formatting
1. **Markdown**: Primary formatting with bold/italic text
2. **HTML**: Fallback if Markdown parsing fails
3. **Plain Text**: Final fallback for maximum compatibility

## 🎯 Key Features

- ✅ **Flexible Positioning**: `@all` can be anywhere in the message
- ✅ **Case Insensitive**: Works with `@all`, `@ALL`, `@All`, etc.
- ✅ **Multiple Fallbacks**: Markdown → HTML → Plain Text
- ✅ **Clean Formatting**: Removes `@all` from the final message
- ✅ **Attribution**: Shows who triggered the mention
- ✅ **Length Validation**: Prevents messages over 4096 characters
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging and recovery

## 🧪 Test Cases

Try these examples in your configured group:

```
@all
Hello @all
@all meeting in 10 minutes
Good morning @all hope everyone is well
@ALL (uppercase)
Multiple @all @all mentions (will remove all instances)
```

## 📋 Configuration

The feature works with the existing `MENTION_CONFIG`:
- `TARGET_GROUP_ID`: Specific group where @all works
- `CHOSEN_MEMBERS`: Array of usernames to mention

## 🔍 Validation & Security

- **Group Restriction**: Only works in the configured target group
- **Username Validation**: Filters valid usernames (max 32 chars, alphanumeric + underscore)
- **Message Length**: Prevents Telegram API errors from oversized messages
- **Character Escaping**: Properly escapes special characters in all formatting modes

## 📱 User Experience

### For Regular Users
- More natural: Can include @all in normal conversation
- Flexible: Works with any message content
- Clear attribution: Always shows who triggered the mention

### For Administrators
- Same configuration as before
- Enhanced logging for debugging
- Multiple fallback methods ensure reliability

## 🚀 Deployment Status

✅ **Ready for immediate use**
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Backward compatible with old `@all` usage
- Enhanced error handling prevents failures

The enhanced @all feature is now live and ready for testing!
